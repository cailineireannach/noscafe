	       <h2>What We Do</h2>
	       <p>Nós Café is a coffee shop located in the heart of Dublin's cultural hub; Temple Bar.
         It's main purpose is to provide a range of traditional Irish food with a modern twist.
       All of this served through the medium of the Irish language (Gaeilge). Nós provides a comfortable
     and friendly atmosphere for Irish speakers to meet and chat, as well as those learning the language.
   There is no better way to learn than to immerse yourself in language itself, without fear of making mistakes.
 Our staff are as passionate about the language as they are about offering you with the best service in town!

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Nós began as a small idea in the mind of a few Irish speakers who were living
      in Dublin. Finding it difficult to meet other fellow speakers of the language, and
    genuinely saddened by the lack of Irish spoken (even basic sentences) by the local population,
  these Gaeilgeoirs decided to face the problem head on and create and permanent place
where Irish, rather than English, was the main language. Now steadily becoming a thriving
hub for fluent speakers as well as learners and tourists alike, Nós provides a greatly needed
service to the people of the inner city. Now more and more people are no longer afraid to
use their cúpla focail in this casual and open environment.</p>

      <h2>Our Services</h2>
      <p>Nós provides quality Irish food and drink that can boast a 95% Irish origin (
        coffee beans have yet to be grown successfully in our temperate climate). All recipies
      are inspired by traditional sources passed down through generations. For more see the menu page.</p>
    </br>
      <p>As well as an excellent menu, the café hosts weekly meet-ups and casual classes where
        language learners and native speakers gather to share their love of the language. All are welcome
        even just to sit-in and take in the atmosphere with a nice cupán tae! We also host traditional
        music sessions every weekend, giving local bands a change to show their skills. For
        more see the events page.
